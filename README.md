# Modeling and Simulation of Advanced Nuclear Reactors and Fuel Cycles

Invited seminar for the Spring 2017 UC Davis [Mechanical and Aerospace
Engineering seminar series](https://moorepants.github.io/mae297/). 

Nuclear power provides the majority of our nation's safe, reliable, carbon free
energy. Advanced nuclear reactors and nuclear fuel cycles promise to further
improve passive safety, fuel utilization, and environmental impacts of this key
energy source. This seminar will discuss open, reproducible, computational
approaches to modeling and simulation of the multiple coupled physics and
scales inherent to these systems. Approaches will include (1) agent based
modeling of future energy growth, reprocessing, and fuel management scenarios,
(2) the interplay between probabilistic and deterministic neutron transport
methods for design and safety analysis, and (3) development of reactor physics
kernels for the MOOSE (multiphysics object oriented simulation environment)
framework.
